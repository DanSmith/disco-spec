## DDI Discovery Vocabulary

This repository contains specifications and documentation for the **DDI Discovery Vocabulary**, an RDF Schema vocabulary that enables discovery of research and survey data on the Web. It is based on [DDI](http://www.ddialliance.org/) (Data Documentation Initiative) XML formats.

Work on this vocabulary was started at a GESIS workshop in Dagstuhl in 2011, continued in the margins of EDDI2011 in Göteborg, and further continued in Dagstuhl in October 2012.
