This specification defines the DDI Discovery Vocabulary, an RDF Schema vocabulary that enables discovery of research and survey data on the Web. It is based on DDI (Data Documentation Initiative) XML formats.
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Here's the <a href="http://www.essepuntato.it/lode/owlapi/https://raw.github.com/linked-statistics/disco-spec/master/discovery.ttl">LODE view</a> of the whole thing. And here's the <a href="https://raw.github.com/linked-statistics/disco-spec/master/discovery.ttl">Turtle source</a>. And <a href="https://github.com/linked-statistics/disco-spec/issues">open issues</a>.</p>

    <section>
      <h3>Scope and Purpose</h3>

      <p>This specification is designed to support the discovery of
      microdata sets and related metadata using RDF technologies in the
      Web of Linked Data. Many archives and other organizations have
      large amounts of data, sometimes publically available, but often
      confidential in nature, requiring applications for access. Many
      such organizations use the
      <a href="http://www.ddialliance.org/what">Data Documentation Initiative</a>
      standard, which is a proven and highly detailed XML metadata
      format for describing rectangular data sets of this type.
      This vocabulary leverages the DDI specification to create a
      simplified version of this model for the discovery of data files.</p>

      <p>The data holdings of data archives are often collected by
      researchers, and only afterwards disseminated by archives. Other
      data-producing organizations such as research centers and
      statistical agencies are also increasingly interested in the
      DDI standards for documenting their own micro-data. In general
      terms, most DDI metadata describes data sets for the social,
      behavioural, and economic sciences. This data is fairly
      consistent in format, consisting of rectangular data files with
      columns containing variables for a set of cases, contained in
      the rows. It is often collected by survey, although in some
      cases may come from administrative sources, sensors, or
      registers.</p>

      <p>This vocabulary is intended not only for use by the research
      data community, but also by any others needing an RDF vocabulary
      for describing this type of rectangular data. This vocabulary
      will provide a useful model for describing some of the data sets
      now being published by open government initiatives, by providing
      a rich metadata structure for them. While the data sets may be
      available (typically as CSV files) the metadata which
      accompanies them is not necessarily coherent, making the
      discovery of these data sets difficult. This vocabulary would
      help to overcome this difficulty by allowing for the creation of
      standard queries to programmatically identify data sets, whether
      made available by government or held within a data archive.</p>
    </section>


    <section>
      <h3>About DDI</h3>

      <p>The Data Documentation Initiative standards are produced and
      maintained by a member-based consortium of global scope, the
      <a href="http://www.ddi-alliance.org/">DDI Alliance</a>. Housed
      currently at the
      <a href="http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/">Interuniversity Consortium
      for Political and Social Research</a> (ICPSR) at the University
      of Michigan, there are currently more than 30 member
      institutions. The standards have been under development for more
      than ten years, and are in widespread use among data archives
      and libraries, producers of research data, secure data centers,
      and statistical agencies.</p>

      <p>There are two major versions of DDI: the
      “<a href="http://www.ddialliance.org/Specification/DDI-Codebook/">codebook</a>”
      version, which is an XML format for holding general information
      about a study, along with its data dictionary; and the
      “<a href="http://www.ddialliance.org/Specification/DDI-Lifecycle/">Lifecycle</a>”
      version of DDI, which allows for the description of more complex
      multi-wave studies, throughout the data lifecycle, from study 
      conception through data collection and processing.</p>

      <p>This vocabulary is not specific to either of these versions,
      but represents the major types of metadata they contain in a
      highly simplified form, for the purposes of discovery. The XML
      Codebook and Lifecycle versions of DDI are very broad: these
      standards contain hundreds of metadata elements, providing
      enough information to programmatically work with the data files
      for such functions as the automatic creation of databases, and
      transformations between statistical packages. DDI in both
      versions is generally used to describe data found in ASCII
      files, whether positional files with fixed-width fields or files
      using a delimited format such as CSV.</p>

      <p>It is difficult to claim that there is a single agreed
      conceptual model for describing research data in the social,
      behavioural, and economic sciences—there is a wide range of
      models and terms. However, the issues faced in this area have
      been the subject of discussion within the DDI community for many
      years, and the DDI model represents the best consensus which
      exists today. As such, it gives us a good basis for creating a
      vocabulary which will be recognizable to researchers familiar
      with this type of data.</p>

      <h2>Relationship to Data Cube and DCAT</h2>

      <p>The Discovery Vocabulary is aligned to several other metadata
      vocabularies used in the RDF community.</p>

      <p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/">Data Catalog
      Vocabulary</a> (DCAT) is a W3C standard for describing catalogs
      of datasets, and we map to it in two places:
      Our LogicalDataSet is a subclass of DCAT’s Dataset, and our
      DataFile is a subclass of DCAT’s Distribution. DCAT makes few
      assumptions about the kind of datasets being described,
      and focuses on general metadata about the datasets
      (mostly using Dublin Core), and on different ways of
      distributing and accessing the dataset, including availability
      of the dataset in multiple formats. Combining terms from both
      DCAT and the Discovery Vocabulary can be useful for a number of
      reasons:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Describing collections (catalogs) of research datasets</li>
        <li>Providing additional information about physical aspects (file size, file formats) of research data files</li>
        <li>Providing information about the data collection that produced the datasets in a data catalog</li>
        <li>Providing information about the logical structure (variables, concepts, etc.) of tabular datasets in a data catalog</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/">Data Cube
      vocabulary</a> is a W3C standard for representing data cubes,
      that is, multidimensional aggregate data. Data cubes are often
      generated by tabulating or aggregating record-level datasets.
      For example, if an observation in a census data cube indicates
      the population of a certain age group in a certain region is
      12345, then this fact was obtained by aggregating that number of
      individual records from a record-level (or “microdata”) dataset.
      The Discovery Vocabulary contains a property “aggregation” that
      indicates that a Cube dataset was derived by tabulating a
      record-level dataset.</p>

      <p>Data Cube provides for the description of the structure of 
      such cubes, but also for the representation of the cube data
      itself, that is, the observations that make up the cube dataset.
      This is not the case for the the Discovery Vocabulary, which
      only describes the structure of a dataset, but is not concerned
      with representing the actual data in it. The actual data is
      assumed to sit in a data file (e.g., a CSV file, or in a
      proprietary stats package file format) that is not represented
      in RDF.</p>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
    </section>

    <section id='example'>
      <h2>A worked example</h2>

      <p>We have a sample of a survey which has been documented using
      DDI XML—the 1980 Argentine National Population and Housing
      Census. The version of this data we are using as our example is
      the one disseminated by <a href="http://www.ipums.org/">IPUMS</a>,
      which provides internationally harmonized census data, to make
      it more useful for cross-border research. Thus, this data set is
      produced by two organizations: The Argentine National Institute
      of Statistics and Censuses, and the Minnesota Population Center
      housed in the University of Minnesota.</p>

      <p>To give some idea of what is contained in the metadata set,
      we will use some screen shots from a portal which indexes the
      DDI files to facilitate searching, and reflects the contents in
      a fashion which is easy to view.</p>

      <div class="figure">
        <img src="images/example-overview.png">
      </div>

      <p>Figure 1 shows us the overview page for this study, giving us
      some basic information—data producers, title, year, country, and
      a link to the access policies. If we look at the right-hand
      panel, we see an outline of the metadata contents of the file,
      including information about the questionnaire used, sampling
      methodology, and data collection activities, as well as detailed
      information about the variables contained in the two data
      files.</p>

      <p>Not all of this information is useful in a data discovery
      scenario—sampling and data collection methodologies is not
      typically indexed for searches. Information about the
      questionnaire is, as is detailed information about the variables
      contained in the files. We will look more closely at the
      metadata of primary interest for our discovery scenario.</p>

      <div class="figure">
        <img src="images/example-access-policy.png" alt="Access policy">
      </div>

      <p>Figure 2 shows us the information about access policies,
      which typically is of interest to those searching for data.</p>

      <div class="figure">
        <img src="images/example-sampling-universe.png" alt="Sampling information">
      </div>

      <p>While the sampling methodology may not be of great interest
      for those searching for data, one field within this section is:
      the “universe”, that is, the population being studied. Figure 3
      gives us an example of this information.</p>

      <p>In some cases we may have a lot of information about the
      questionnaires used, and it is very common to search for data by
      the text of the question used to collect it. Sometimes there
      will be a PDF of a questionnaire, and sometimes question text
      may be linked to individual variables within a file. In this
      case, we have only a textual description of the set of forms
      used in the census (Figure 4).</p>

      <div class="figure">
        <img src="images/example-questionnaires.png" alt="Questionnaires">
      </div>

      <p>Next we find some general information about the data files
      produced by this study (Figure 5.)</p>

      <div class="figure">
        <img src="images/example-general-data-file-info.png" alt="General data set information">
      </div>

      <p>In Figure 6 we see the list of variables contained in the
      data file. For each of these we will also have a detailed view,
      showing the codes and categories used to encode the actual
      responses in the variables (Figure 7).</p>

      <div class="figure">
        <img src="images/example-variable-list.png" alt="Variables list">
      </div>

      <div class="figure">
        <img src="images/example-variable-detail.png" alt="Variable details">
      </div>

      <p>At the bottom of the screen showing the variable detail, we
      can see that the variable for roofing material is associated
      with a high-level concept, “Dwelling characteristics variables.”
      (Figure 8.)</p>
