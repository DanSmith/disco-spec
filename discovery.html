<p>Work on this specification was kicked off at a <a href="http://www.gesis.org">GESIS</a> workshop in <a href="http://www.dagstuhl.de/">Schloss Dagstuhl</a> in September 2011, co-organized by Joachim Wackerow, Arofan Gregory, and Wendy Thomas. Work was continued at subsequent working meetings in Göteborg and Dagstuhl.</p>

<p>Many participants to these workshops have greatly contributed to the design and creation of the Discovery Vocabulary, including Benjamin Zapilko, Benedikt Kämpgen, Dan Smith, Johanna Vompras, Larry Hoyle, Matthaeus Zloch, and Olof Olsson.</p>
