      <p>
        Here's the <a href="http://www.essepuntato.it/lode/owlapi/https://raw.github.com/linked-statistics/disco-spec/master/discovery.ttl">LODE view</a> of the whole thing.

And <a href="https://github.com/linked-statistics/disco-spec/issues">open issues</a>.</p>

    <section>
      <h3>Scope and Purpose</h3>

      <p>This specification is designed to support the discovery of
      microdata sets and related metadata using RDF technologies in the
      Web of Linked Data. Many archives and other organizations have
      large amounts of data, sometimes publically available, but often
      confidential in nature, requiring applications for access. Many
      such organizations use the
      <a href="http://www.ddialliance.org/what">Data Documentation Initiative</a>
      standard, which is a proven and highly detailed XML metadata
      format for describing rectangular data sets of this type.
      This vocabulary leverages the DDI specification to create a
      simplified version of this model for the discovery of data files.</p>

      <p>The data holdings of data archives are often collected by
      researchers, and only afterwards disseminated by archives. Other
      data-producing organizations such as research centers and
      statistical agencies are also increasingly interested in the
      DDI standards for documenting their own micro-data. In general
      terms, most DDI metadata describes data sets for the social,
      behavioural, and economic sciences. This data is fairly
      consistent in format, consisting of rectangular data files with
      columns containing variables for a set of cases, contained in
      the rows. It is often collected by survey, although in some
      cases may come from administrative sources, sensors, or
      registers.</p>

      <p>This vocabulary is intended not only for use by the research
      data community, but also by any others needing an RDF vocabulary
      for describing this type of rectangular data. This vocabulary
      will provide a useful model for describing some of the data sets
      now being published by open government initiatives, by providing
      a rich metadata structure for them. While the data sets may be
      available (typically as CSV files) the metadata which
      accompanies them is not necessarily coherent, making the
      discovery of these data sets difficult. This vocabulary would
      help to overcome this difficulty by allowing for the creation of
      standard queries to programmatically identify data sets, whether
      made available by government or held within a data archive.</p>
    </section>


    <section>
      <h3>About DDI</h3>

      <p>The Data Documentation Initiative standards are produced and
      maintained by a member-based consortium of global scope, the
      <a href="http://www.ddi-alliance.org/">DDI Alliance</a>. Housed
      currently at the
      <a href="http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/">Interuniversity Consortium
      for Political and Social Research</a> (ICPSR) at the University
      of Michigan, there are currently more than 30 member
      institutions. The standards have been under development for more
      than ten years, and are in widespread use among data archives
      and libraries, producers of research data, secure data centers,
      and statistical agencies.</p>

      <p>There are two major versions of DDI: the
      “<a href="http://www.ddialliance.org/Specification/DDI-Codebook/">codebook</a>”
      version, which is an XML format for holding general information
      about a study, along with its data dictionary; and the
      “<a href="http://www.ddialliance.org/Specification/DDI-Lifecycle/">Lifecycle</a>”
      version of DDI, which allows for the description of more complex
      multi-wave studies, throughout the data lifecycle, from study 
      conception through data collection and processing.</p>

      <p>This vocabulary is not specific to either of these versions,
      but represents the major types of metadata they contain in a
      highly simplified form, for the purposes of discovery. The XML
      Codebook and Lifecycle versions of DDI are very broad: these
      standards contain hundreds of metadata elements, providing
      enough information to programmatically work with the data files
      for such functions as the automatic creation of databases, and
      transformations between statistical packages. DDI in both
      versions is generally used to describe data found in ASCII
      files, whether positional files with fixed-width fields or files
      using a delimited format such as CSV.</p>

      <p>It is difficult to claim that there is a single agreed
      conceptual model for describing research data in the social,
      behavioural, and economic sciences—there is a wide range of
      models and terms. However, the issues faced in this area have
      been the subject of discussion within the DDI community for many
      years, and the DDI model represents the best consensus which
      exists today. As such, it gives us a good basis for creating a
      vocabulary which will be recognizable to researchers familiar
      with this type of data.</p>

      <h2>Relationship to Data Cube, DCAT and XKOS</h2>

      <p>The Discovery Vocabulary is aligned to several other metadata
      vocabularies used in the RDF community.</p>

      <p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/">Data Catalog
      Vocabulary</a> (DCAT) is a W3C standard for describing catalogs
      of datasets, and we map to it in two places:
      Our LogicalDataSet is a subclass of DCAT’s Dataset, and our
      DataFile is a subclass of DCAT’s Distribution. DCAT makes few
      assumptions about the kind of datasets being described,
      and focuses on general metadata about the datasets
      (mostly using Dublin Core), and on different ways of
      distributing and accessing the dataset, including availability
      of the dataset in multiple formats. Combining terms from both
      DCAT and the Discovery Vocabulary can be useful for a number of
      reasons:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Describing collections (catalogs) of research datasets</li>
        <li>Providing additional information about physical aspects (file size, file formats) of research data files</li>
        <li>Providing information about the data collection that produced the datasets in a data catalog</li>
        <li>Providing information about the logical structure (variables, concepts, etc.) of tabular datasets in a data catalog</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/">Data Cube
      vocabulary</a> is a W3C standard for representing data cubes,
      that is, multidimensional aggregate data. Data cubes are often
      generated by tabulating or aggregating record-level datasets.
      For example, if an observation in a census data cube indicates
      the population of a certain age group in a certain region is
      12345, then this fact was obtained by aggregating that number of
      individual records from a record-level (or “microdata”) dataset.
      The Discovery Vocabulary contains a property “aggregation” that
      indicates that a Cube dataset was derived by tabulating a
      record-level dataset.</p>

      <p>Data Cube provides for the description of the structure of 
      such cubes, but also for the representation of the cube data
      itself, that is, the observations that make up the cube dataset.
      This is not the case for the the Discovery Vocabulary, which
      only describes the structure of a dataset, but is not concerned
      with representing the actual data in it. The actual data is
      assumed to sit in a data file (e.g., a CSV file, or in a
      proprietary stats package file format) that is not represented
      in RDF.</p>

      <p>The use of formal statistical classifications is very common
      in research data sets—these are treated in our vocabulary as
      SKOS concepts, but in some cases those working with formal
      statistical classifications may desire more expressive
      capability than SKOS provides. To support such users, the DDI
      Alliance also publishes
      <a href="http://purl.org/linked-data/xkos">XKOS</a>, a
      vocabulary which extends SKOS
      to allow for a more complete description of such
      classifications. While the use of XKOS is not required by this
      vocabulary, the two are designed to work in complementary fashion.</p>

      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <div class="figure">
        <img src="diagrams/overview.jpg" alt="Vocabulary overview">
      </div>

      <p>To understand the DDI Discovery Vocabulary, there are a few
      central classes, which can serve as entry points. The first of
      these is the Study class. A <b>Study</b> in our model represents the
      process by which a data set was generated or collected. Literal
      properties include information about the funding, organizational
      affiliation, abstract, title, version, and other such high-level
      information. In some cases, where data collection is cyclic or
      on-going, data sets may be released as a <b>StudyGroup</b>, where each
      cycle or "wave" of the data collection activity produces one or
      more data sets. This is typical for longitudinal studies, panel
      studies, and other types of "series" (to use the DDI term). In
      this case, a number of Study objects would be collected into a
      single StudyGroup.</p>
 
      <p>Data sets have two representations in our model: a logical
      representation, which describes the contents of the data set,
      and a physical representation, which is a distributed file
      holding that data. It is possible to format data files in many
      different ways, even if the logical content is the same. In our
      model the <b>LogicalDataSet</b> represents the content of the file
      (its organization into a set of Variables). The LogicalDataSet
      is an extension of the dact:DataSet class. Physical, distributed
      files are represented by the class <b>DataFile</b> (not depicted in the diagram), which is itself an
      extension of the dcat:Distribution.</p>
 
      <p>When it comes to understanding the contents of the data set,
      this is done using the <b>Variable</b> class. Variables provide a
      definition of the column in a rectangular data file, and can
      associate it with a Concept, and a <b>Question</b> (the Question in the
      <b>Questionnaire</b> which was used to collect the data). Variables are
      related to a representation of some form, which may be a set of
      codes and categories (a "codelist") or may be one of other
      normal data types (dateTime, numeric, textual, etc.) Codes and
      Categories are represented using SKOS concepts and concept
      schemes.</p>
 
      <p>Data is collected about a specific phenomenon, typically
      involving some target population, and focusing on the analysis
      of a particular type of subject. These are respectively
      represented by the <b>Universe</b> class and the <b>AnalysisUnit</b> class.
      If, for example, the adult population of Finland is being
      studied, the AnalysisUnit would be individuals or persons.</p>
    </section>


    <section id='example'>
      <h2>A Worked Example</h2>

      <p>We have a sample of a survey which has been documented using
      DDI XML—the 1980 Argentine National Population and Housing
      Census. The version of this data we are using as our example is
      the one disseminated by <a href="http://www.ipums.org/">IPUMS</a>,
      which provides internationally harmonized census data, to make
      it more useful for cross-border research. Thus, this data set is
      produced by two organizations: The Argentine National Institute
      of Statistics and Censuses, and the Minnesota Population Center
      housed in the University of Minnesota.</p>

      <p>To give some idea of what is contained in the metadata set,
      we will use some screen shots from OpenMetadata Survey Catalog, 
      a portal which indexes the
      DDI files to facilitate searching, and reflects the contents in
      a fashion which is easy to view. Follow this 
      <a href="http://www.openmetadata.org/surveycatalog/index.php/catalog/996">link</a>
       for the information about this DDI file at the OpenMetadata Survey Catalog.</p>

      <div class="figure">
        <img src="images/example-overview.png">
      </div>

      <p>Figure 1 shows us the overview page for this study, giving us
      some basic information - title, an identifier for the study, data producers, year, country, and
      a link to the access policies. If we look at the right-hand
      panel, we see an outline of the metadata contents of the file,
      including information about the questionnaire used, sampling
      methodology, and data collection activities, as well as detailed
      information about the variables contained in the two data
      files.</p>

      <p>Not all of this information is useful in a data discovery
      scenario—sampling and data collection methodologies is not
      typically indexed for searches. Information about the
      questionnaire is, as is detailed information about the variables
      contained in the files. We will look more closely at the
      metadata of primary interest for our discovery scenario.</p>
      
      Using RDF and the DDI Discovery Vocabulary, the study can also be described in triples:
      
      An instance of type disco:Study is given the title and the identifier; also, the two 
      data producers are linked and further described.
      
      The year and country are described in the form of a temporal and spatial coverage of the study. 
      Also, the topics of the study are represented.
	  
	  The study instance further contains an abstract.
	  
	  Since a study is an versionable object in DDI, we attach a version to it.
	  
	  A study further is described using various additional information, described further below.

	Any variable definition has a representation defining the possible values of a variable. 
	
	Also, a variable definition has its own universe (possibly the same as the study, possibly a 
	narrower one) and (DDI) concepts further describing the variable.

	Any universe of a variable definition is a subset of the universe of the entire study.
	
	In our example, two questions are addressing the universe of persons, the third question

      <p>While the sampling methodology may not be of great interest
      for those searching for data, one field within this section is:
      the “universe”, that is, the population being studied. Figure 3
      gives us an example of this information.</p>

      <p>In some cases we may have a lot of information about the
      questionnaires used, and it is very common to search for data by
      the text of the question used to collect it. Sometimes there
      will be a PDF of a questionnaire, and sometimes question text
      may be linked to individual variables within a file. In this
      case, we have only a textual description of the set of forms
      used in the census (Figure 4).</p>

      <div class="figure">

      <h2>Studies and StudyGroups</h2>

	  <p>A simple <b>Study</b> supports the stages of the full data lifecycle 
	  in a modular manner. A Study represents the
      process by which a data set was generated or collected. Literal
      properties include information about the funding, organizational
      affiliation, abstract, title, version, and other such high-level
      information. The key criteria for a study are: 
	  a single conceptual model (e.g. survey research concept), 
	  a single instrument (e.g. questionnaire) made up of one or more parts 
	  (ex. employer survey, worker survey), and a single logical data structure 
	  of the initial raw data (multiple data files can be created from this such 
	  as a public use microdata file or aggregate data files).
	  In some cases, where data collection is cyclic or
      on-going, data sets may be released as a <b>StudyGroup</b>, where each
      cycle or "wave" of the data collection activity produces one or
      more data sets. This is typical for longitudinal studies, panel
      studies, and other types of "series" (to use the DDI term). In
      this case, a number of Study objects would be collected into a
      single StudyGroup.</p>
	  
	  <p>
	    Studies may be contained in at most 1 StudyGroup and groups of Studies may include 
		0 to n studies.
		Studies may have 0 to n disco:instrument relationships to Instruments.
		Particular Instruments, however, are connected with exactly 1 Study.
		Studies may have disco:dataFile connections with 0 to n DataFiles and DataFiles must have 
		1 to n disco:dataFile relationships to Studies.  
		Studies are associated with 0 to n Variables using the object property disco:variable.
		On the other hand, Variables must be related to 1 to n Studies.
		Studies may have 0 to n LogicalDataSets (disco:product) and LogicalDataSets must 
        have 1 to n disco:product relationships to Studies.

	    Studies or StudyGroups (the <b>union of Study and StudyGroup</b>) 
	    may have different datatype properties. 
	    Studies or groups of Studies may have an abstract (dcterms:abstract), a title
        (dcterms:title), a subtitle (disco:subtitle), an alternative title
        (dcterms:alternative), a purpose (disco:purpose), and information about
        the date and the time since when the Study is publicly available
        (dcterms:available). Studies or StudyGroups may have multiple object properties.
	    The object properties disco:kindOfData and
        dcterms:subject guide to skos:Concepts. 
	    Disco:kindOfData describes, with a string or a term from a controlled vocabulary, 
	    the kind of data documented in the logical product(s) of a Study. 
	    Examples include survey data, census/enumeration data, administrative data, measurement data, assessment data, demographic data, voting data, etc.
	    You can use dcterms:subject to describe the topical coverage of Studies and groups of Studies.
	    Disco:ddiFile leads to foaf:Documents which are the DDI-XML files 
	    containing further descriptions of the Study or the StudyGroup.
	    Use dcterms:temporal for temporal coverages related to the union of Studies and StudyGroups.
		For the spatial coverage use dcterms:spatial.
		The cardinalities of all the object properties are in both directions 0 to n.
		The only exception is that Studies and StudyGroups may have 0 or 1 disco:kindOfData 
		relationships to skos:Concepts.

	  <p>
		<b>Universe</b> is the total membership or population of a defined class of people, 
		objects or events. There are two types of population, target population and 
		survey population. A target population is the population outlined in the survey 
		objects about which information is to be sought. A survey population (also known
		as the coverage of the survey) is the population from which information can be 
		obtained in the survey. 

		<b>AnalysisUnit</b> is defined as follows: The process collecting data is focusing 
		on the analysis of a particular type of subject. If, for example, the adult population
		of Finland is being studied, the AnalysisUnit would be individuals or persons.

		Universe may be in a disco:universe relationship with 0 to n unions of 
		Studies and groups of Studies. Universes are sub-classes of skos:Concepts. 
		For Universes you can state definitions using skos:definition. 

		The union of Study and StudyGroup may have 0 or 1 AnalysisUnit
		reached by the object property disco:analysisUnit and a specific AnalysisUnit may be

	  <h3>DDI-XML Identifiers and Relations to DDI-XML Files</h3>
	  
	  <p>
	    Every entity defined in DDI-RDF is an rdfs:Resource. 
	    General metadata elements which can be used on every resource in a DDI-RDF description include:
      </p>
	  
	  <ul>
		<li>skos:prefLabel (rdf:langString): the preferred label of this element</li>
		<li>disco:ddi2_1identifier (xsd:anyURI): the unique identifier in DDI 2.1</li>

	  <p>Note that in RDF, the unique identifier of a resource is its URI. The identifier properties are only used for easing the linkage between DDI-RDF metadata and the original DDI files.</p>

	  <p>
	    Furthermore, every element can be related to any foaf:Document using dcterms:relation.
		The cardinalities are in both directions 0 to n.

	  <p>
	    Access rights are defined in a <b>dcterms:RightsStatement</b> object, 
		which may reference an external document stating the access rights in more detail (rdfs:seeAlso).

	    <h3>Coverage of Studies, Logical Datasets, and Data Files</h3>
		<p>Coverage comprehends the key features of the scope of the data (e.g. geographic product occupation). Studies, logical datasets, and data files may have a spatial, temporal, and topical coverage. Unlike in DDI-XML, there is no dedicated Coverage type in DDI-RDF. In contrast, spatial, temporal, and topical coverage are directly attached to the respective study, logical dataset, and datafile.</p>
		<p>For spatial coverage, <b>dcterms:spatial</b> is used, pointing to any geographic location (dcterms:Location):</p>
		<pre>
ex:study1 dcterms:spatial &lt;http://sws.geonames.org/2921044/&gt; .		
		</pre>
		<p>In this example, <a href="http://www.geonames.org/">Geonames</a> is used to refer to a spatial region, in this case, the country Germany. Geonames provides URIs for continents, countries, regions, and cities, among others, and is therefore a possible option to use for describing spatial coverage.</p>
        
		<div class="figure">
          <img src="diagrams/study-coverage.jpg" alt="Study Coverage">
        </div>
		
		<p>
		  For temporal coverage, <b>dcterms:temporal</b> is used pointing to dcterms:PeriodOfTime.
          For time periods, labels can be attachted (skos:prefLabel). It is also possible to define 
		  start (disco:startDate) and end dates (disco:endDate).  
		  
		  A possible way to describe temporal coverage is the use of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-time/">W3C time ontology</a>:
		</p>
		
		<pre>
ex:study1 dcterms:temporal [
  a time:Interval ;
  time:hasBeginning [ time:inXSDDateTime
    "2012-01-01T00:00:00+01:00"^^xsd:dateTime ];
  time:hasEnd [ time:inXSDDateTime
    "2012-01-31T23:59:59+01:00"^^xsd:dateTime ] ] .		
		</pre>
		<p>This example describes a study that has been conducted between January 1st and January 31st.</p>
		
		<div class="figure">
          <img src="diagrams/logical-data-set-coverage.jpg" alt="LogicalDataSet Coverage">
        </div>
		
		<p>Topical coverage can be expressed using <b>dcterms:subject</b>. DDI-RDF foresees the use skos:Concept for the description of topical coverage:</p>
		<pre>
ex:study1 dcterms:subject [
  a skos:Concept ;
  skos:prefLabel "Alcohol consumption" ] .
		</pre>
		
		<div class="figure">
          <img src="diagrams/data-file-coverage.jpg" alt="DataFile Coverage">
        </div>

		  The multiplicities for each of the three object properties dcterms:subject, dcterms:temporal, and dcterms:spatial are in any case 0 to n.
		</p>
		
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3>Other General Dublin Core Metadata Properties</h3>
			<p>The following elements from Dublin Core may be used to describe general metadata of DDI-RDF elements (see the DC definitions for more detailed descriptions):</p>
			<ul>
				<li>dcterms:abstract (used with disco:Study): an abstract of the study</li>
				<li>dcterms:alternative (used with disco:Study): an alternative name for the study</li>
				<li>dcterms:available (used with disco:Study): the date (or date range) at which this study has or will become available</li>
				<li>dcterms:title (used with disco:Study, disco:LogicalDataSet): the element’s title</li>
				<li>dcterms:description (used with disco:DataElement, disco:DataFile, disco:Instrument, disco:Variable, dcterms:RightsStatement): a human readable description of the element</li>

      <h2>Data Sets, Data Files, and Descriptive Statistics</h2>

	  <p>Data sets have two representations in our model: a logical
      representation, which describes the contents of the data set,
      and a physical representation, which is a distribuited file
      holding that data. It is possible to format data files in many
      different ways, even if the logical content is the same. In our
      model the <b>LogicalDataSet</b> represents the content of the file
      (its organization into a set of Variables). The LogicalDataSet
      is an extension of the dact:DataSet class. Physical, distributed
      files are represented by the class <b>DataFile</b>, which is itself an
      extension of the dcat:Distribution. <b>DescriptiveStatistics</b>
	  , i.e. SummaryStatistics as well as CategoryStatistics, are accociated with 
	  DataFiles by the object property disco:statisticsDataFile. </p>
	  
      <div class="figure">

	  <p>
	    LogicalDataSets and DataFiles are

	    may be linked to 0 to n DataFiles and a particular DataFile may be connected
	    with 0 to n LogicalDataSets via disco:dataFile.
	    DescriptiveStatistics are accociated with 
	    DataFiles by the object property disco:statisticsDataFile. A concrete 
	    DescriptiveStatistics object may have disco:statisticsDataFile relationships 
	    to multiple (0 - n) Datafiles. DataFiles, however, may have 0 to n statisticsDataFile relations to 
	    DescriptiveStatistics instances.

      <h3>LogicalDataSet</h3>
	  
      <p>

	    the processing of data, at the time of collection or later during cleaning, and re-coding.  
	    LogicalDataSet represents the microdata dataset. 
	  </p>

      <div class="figure">
        <img src="diagrams/logical-data-set.jpg" alt="LogicalDataSet">
      </div>

      <p>
	    LogicalDataSet is defined as a sub-class of dcat:Dataset.
		You can state a title (dcterms:title) and a flag indicating if the
        microdata dataset is publicly available (isPublic). 
	    You can specify access rights (dcterms:accessRights) and LicenseStatements
		(dcterms:license) for microdata datasets.
        For LogicalDataSets the three dimensions of coverage can be specified:
		spatial (dcterms:spatial), temporal (dcterms:temporal), and topical (dcteerms:subject).
		The cardinalities of the object properties dcterms:spatial, dcterms:temporal, dcterms:subject,
		dcterms:accessRights, and dcterms:license are 0 to n.
	    Microdata datasets may have disco:instrument associations to 
	    multiple (0 - n) Instruments and Instruments are connected with 
	    multiple (0 - n) LogicalDataSets.
		Each LogicalDataSet has exactly 1 Universe (disco:universe) and 
		one specific Universe may be in multiple (0 - n) disco:universe 
		relations to LogicalDataSets.		
		LogicalDataSets may contain (disco:containsVariable) 0 to n Variables and 
		Variables must be contained in 1 to n LogicaDataSets.
		LogicalDataSets can be aggregated (disco:aggregation) to 0 to n DataSets and 
		DataSets can be aggregations of 0 to n LogicalDataSets. 
		At last, LogicalDataSets refer to 0 to n DataFiles using the object property 
		disco:dataFile and DataFiles may be linked to 0 to n LogicalDataSets.
		The class DataSet is defined in the RDF Data Cube
        Vocabulary. 0 to n DataSets may point to multiple (0 - n) Variables
        (disco:inputVariable).

      <h3>DataFile</h3>

	  <p>
	    The collected data result in the microdata represented by the <b>DataFile</b>.
	    Data sets have a logical representation, which describes the contents of the data set,
        and a physical representation, which is a distribuited file
        holding that data. It is possible to format data files in many
        different ways, even if the logical content is the same. 
        DataFiles, which are also dcterms:Datasets as well as dcat:Distributions,
        represents all the physical distributed data files containing the microdata datasets.
      </p>
	  
	  <div class="figure">
        <img src="diagrams/data-file.jpg" alt="DataFile">
      </div>
	  
	  <p>
        It is possible to describe DataFiles (dcterms:description).
		DataFiles’ case quantities (disco:caseQuantity) and versions (owl:versionInfo) can also be stated. 
		Using the object property dcterms:format, DataFiles formats can be defined.
		DataFiles must have exactly 1 dcterms:format relationship to an instance of the class 
		dcterms:MediaTypeOrExtend which is a sub-class of skos:Concept.
		Specific formats can be assigned to multiple (0 - n) DataFiles.
		Provenance information can be assigned to DataFiles. DataFiles may have multiple (0 - n)
        dcterms:provenance relationships to dcterms:ProvenanceStatements.
        Dcterms:ProvenanceStatements, however, may have 0 to n dcterms:provenance relations to DataFiles.
        The topical, spatial, and temporal coverage of DataFiles is realized by 
        the object properties dcterms:subject, dcterms:spatial, and dcterms:temporal,
        all with the cardinalities 0 to n on both sides.

      <h3>DescriptiveStatistics</h3>

      <p>
	    An overview over the microdata can be given either by the descriptive statistics 
		or the aggregated data. <b>DescriptiveStatistics</b> may be minimal, maximal, mean values, 
		and absolute and relative frequencies. qb:<b>DataSet</b> originates from the RDF Data Cube Vocabulary, 
		an approach to map the SDMX information model to an ontology. A DataSet represents aggregated data 
		(also known as macrodata) such as multi-dimensional tables. Aggregated data are derived from microdata 
		by statistics on groups, or aggregates such as counts, means, or frequencies.
	    <b>SummaryStatistics</b> pointing to variables and
        <b>CategoryStatistics</b> pointing to categories and codes are both
        descriptive statistics.
       </p>
	   
	   <div class="figure">
        <img src="diagrams/descriptive-statistics.jpg" alt="DescriptiveStatistics">

       <p>	   
		     You can state maximum values (disco:maximum), minimum values (disco:minimum),
         standard deviations (disco:standardDeviation), etc. for summary statistics and you can define
         frequencies (disco:frequency), percentages (disco:percentage), weighted percentages 
		    (disco:weightedPercentage), etc. for category statistics.
		    DescriptiveStatistics may have disco:statisticsDataFile relations to 0 to n DataFiles and
		    DataFiles may be in 0 to n disco:statisticsDataFile relations to DescriptiveStatistics individuals.
		    SummaryStatistics point to 0 to n Variables using the object property disco:statisticsVariable.
		    Variables, however, may be in 0 to n of such relationships to SummaryStatistics objects.
		    CategoryStatistics may be connected with 0 to n skos:Concepts using the property disco:statisticsCategory
        and skos:Concepts representing codes (values) and categories (value labels) may be in 0 to n of such
        relationships.

      <h2>Variables, Variable Definitions, Representations, and Concepts</h2>

	  <p>
	    When it comes to understanding the contents of the data set,
        this is done using the Variable class. <b>Variable</b>s provide a
        definition of the column in a rectangular data file, and can
        associate it with a <b>Concept</b>, and a Question. Variables are
        related to a <b>Representation</b> of some form, which may be a set of
        codes and categories (a "codelist") or may be one of other
        normal data types (dateTime, numeric, textual, etc.) Codes and
        Categories are represented using SKOS <b>Concept</b>s and concept
        schemes. <b>VariableDefinition</b>s encompasse study-independent, 
		re-usable parts of variables like occupation classification.

	    Variables may be based on (disco:basedOn) 0 or 1 VariableDefinition
		and VariableDefinitions can be in 0 to n disco:basedOn relationships to Variables.
		Both Variables and VariableDefinitions have disco:repesentation object properties 
		with the class Representation as range. 
		Variables must have exactly 1 Representation and VariableDefinitions may have 0 to n 
        disco:representation connections to Representations.
        On the other hand, representations have 0 to n links to VariableDefinitions and to Variables.	
        Variables as well as VariableDefinitions have both 1 connection to the concept which should be measured.
        Concepts have 0 to n relationships to Variables and VariableDefinitions using the object property disco:concept.

    <section>
      <h3>Variable and Variable Definition</h3>

	  <p>
	    <b>Variable</b>s provide a definition of the column in a rectangular data file.
		Variable is a characteristic of a unit being observed. A variable might be the 
		answer of a question, have an administrative source, or be derived from other variables. 
	    <b>VariableDefinition</b>s encompasse study-independent, re-usable parts of variables like occupation classification.

	  Variables can be described (dcterms:description), 
		skos:notation is used to associate names to variables and
		labels can be assigned to variables via the datatype property skos:prefLabel.
		VariableDefinitions can also be described using dcterms:description.
		Labels can be assigned to VariableDefinitions via the datatype property 
		skos:prefLabel.
		Variables may be based on (disco:basedOn) 0 to 1 VariableDefinition.
		Disco:basedOn also connects VariableDefinitions with 0 to n Variables.
		Variables and VariableDefinitions are connected with exactly 1 skos:Concept via disco:concept.
		Skos:Concepts have this connection to 0 to n Variables and VariableDefinitions.
		Variables are represented by 1 Representation and VariableDefinitions are represented by multiple (0 - n) Representations.
		Representations may be linked to 0 to n Variables and their definitions.     
		Variables may have (disco:queston) 0 or more Questions and Questions may be associated with 0 to n Variables.
		Disco:universe is used to link 1 Universe to 0 to n Variables and 0 to n Universes to 0 to n VariableDefinitions.

      <h3>skos:Concept and skos:ConceptScheme</h3>

	  <p>
	    SKOS defines the term <b>skos:Concept</b>, which is a unit of knowledge created by a unique 
		combination of characteristics. In context of statistical (meta)data, concepts 
		are abstract summaries, general notions, knowledge of a whole set of behaviours, 
		attitudes or characteristics which are seen as having something in common. 
		Concepts may be associated with variables and questions. 
		A <b>skos:ConceptScheme</b>, also defined within the SKOS namespace, is a set of metadata 
		describing statistical concepts. 
		Skos:Concept is reused to a large extent to represent DDI concepts, codes, and categories.
	  </p>

      <div class="figure">
        <img src="diagrams/concept.jpg" alt="skos:Concept and skos:ConceptScheme">
      </div>
	  
	  <p>
		DDI concepts can be described using skos:definition.
		Furthermore, you can describe code values (skos:notation) and category labels
        (skos:prefLabel).
        Hierarchies of DDI concepts can be built using the object peoperties skos:broader and skos:narrower.
		The domains and the ranges of skos:broader and skos:narrower are skos:Concepts.
        The cardinalities are in both directions 0 to n.
        Skos.Concepts may be organized in 0 to n skos:ConceptSchemes by means of skos:inScheme.
        Skos:ConceptSchemes may have multiple (0 - n) skos:Concepts as parts.
        The top concept in a specific ConceptScheme is indicated by skos:hasTopConcept pointing 
		to 0 to n top skos:Concept. A specific skos:Concept may be the top concept to multiple
        (0 - n) skos:ConceptSchemes.

      <h3>Representation</h3>

	  <p>
	    The <b>Representation</b> of a variable is the combination of a value domain, 
		datatype, and, if necessary, a unit of measure or a character set. 
		Representation is one of a set of values to which a numerical measure or a category 
		from a classification can be assigned (e.g. income, age, and sex: male coded as 1). 
		Questions (disco:responseDomain), Variables
        (disoc:representation), and VariableDefinitions (disco:representation) may have
        representations.
		Representation is defined as sub-class of the union of <b>rdfs:Datatype</b> (e.g. numeric or
        textual values) and <b>skos:ConceptScheme</b>, as for example questions
        may have as response domain a mixture of a numeric response
        domain containing numeric values (rdfs:Datatype) and a code
        response domain (skos:ConceptScheme).

		Questions must have 1 to n Representations,
		Variables must have exactly 1 Representation,
		and VariableDefinitions may have 0 to n Representations.

      <h3>Instrument</h3>

	  <p>
	    The data for the study are collected by an <b>Instrument</b>. 
		The purpose of an Instrument, i.e. an interview, a questionnaire or 
		another entity used as a means of data collection, 
		is in the case of a survey to record the flow of a questionnaire, 
		its use of questions, and additional component parts. 
		A questionnaire contains a flow of questions.

	    You can describe (dcterms:description) Instruments and associate labels
        (skos:prefLabel) to Instruments. 
		Instruments may have (disco:externalDocumentation)
		multiple (0 - n) external documentations which are of the type foaf:Document.
		Foaf:Documents may be external documentations of 0 to n Instruments.
		Questionnaires are special instruments having at
        least 1 (1 - n) collection mode (disco:collectionMode), which is a skos:Concept.
		A specific collection mode can be associated with 0 to n Questionnaires.
		Questionnaires mut contain 1 to n Questions using the object property disco:question.
